I am from Ukraine.

If one day you will decide going to Ukraine to have a tour you should go to the capital of Ukraine Kyiv, Lviv.
In Kiev you can find many beautiful parks, churches, views on the city.
In Lviv you can observe catholic churches, visit beautiful romantic streets and eat Ukrainian national dishes.

You can see a lot of beautiful women in all Ukrainian cities.
